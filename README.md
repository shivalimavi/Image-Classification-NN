# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the use of neural networks to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal is to build a neural network model that can accurately classify these images.

This project uses Python and several machine learning libraries to create and train a neural network for image classification. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. The neural network model is built using the Keras library, and the results are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Model Architecture and Training
The neural network model is built using the Keras Sequential API. The architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 training dataset. The training process involves multiple epochs, where the model learns to classify the images based on the provided labels.
